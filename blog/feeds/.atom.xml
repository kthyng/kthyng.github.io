To do this, use &lt;code&gt;taskset&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;code&gt;taskset 3 python2.7 run.py &amp;gt; temp_log.txt &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;
This command runs the run.py script for a specific project in the background (due to the &amp;amp;), redirects the output from the screen to the text file 'temp_log.txt', and runs the process on core 3. This command can then be used for other instances by choosing a different core after the command &lt;code&gt;taskset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a process is already running, you can check its current core using its PID:
&lt;code&gt;taskset -p [PID]&lt;/code&gt;
Then you can move the process to a different core using
&lt;code&gt;taskset -p [CORE NUMBER] [PID]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June I attended my first SciPy conference. It was in Austin, TX, as usual. I wasn't sure what to expect, this being my first conference about a tool instead of research itself, but I enjoyed it. It was a great opportunity to meet people outside my immediate field and also to meet up with several in my own. I attended tutorials, the conference itself, and the sprints, and throughout, I learned of several new tools to try and about how to best do my research within the framework of open science and reproducibility, both themes of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a plotting competition as part of the conference, the John Hunter Excellence in Plotting competition. I submitted a figure from my research and got second place! A gallery of the entries is &lt;a href="http://conference.scipy.org/jhepc2013/index.html"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. As part of being ranked highly in the competition, I got to sit on the stage at the conference and participate in a panel on visualization practices.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="visualization"></category><category term="plotting"></category><category term="SciPy"></category><category term="conference"></category></entry><entry><title>SciPy Conference and John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Competition</title><link href="http://www.kristenthyng.com/blog/2013/10/14/scipy-plotting-competition/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-14T13:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Kristen Thyng</name></author><id>tag:www.kristenthyng.com/blog,2013-10-14:2013/10/14/scipy-plotting-competition/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In June I attended my first SciPy conference.
