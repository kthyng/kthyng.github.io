It was in Austin, TX, as usual. I wasn't sure what to expect, this being my first conference about a tool instead of research itself, but I enjoyed it. It was a great opportunity to meet people outside my immediate field and also to meet up with several in my own. I attended tutorials, the conference itself, and the sprints, and throughout, I learned of several new tools to try and about how to best do my research within the framework of open science and reproducibility, both themes of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a plotting competition as part of the conference, the John Hunter Excellence in Plotting competition. I submitted a figure from my research and got second place! A gallery of the entries is &lt;a href="http://conference.scipy.org/jhepc2013/index.html"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. As part of being ranked highly in the competition, I got to sit on the stage at the conference and participate in a panel on visualization practices.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="visualization"></category><category term="plotting"></category><category term="SciPy"></category><category term="conference"></category></entry></feed>
